# ModelConverter
This ModelConverter converts Mc Fabric 1.16 to 1.17 Models 

### HowToUse
The code is written in python so you can either fork/copy the code and let your IDE run it (I recommend the Spyder IDE),\
or you can find a ModelConverterX.exe under the Releases Tab.

By starting the exe/code a Window will pop up and ask you which file it should convert.\
Select your desired file and a YOURFILEConvertedModel.java will appear if everything worked fine in the same folder.

The file has to be .java file and the constructor has to have empty ().
